## part1
### Developing and testing with the Activiti Engine
- Running the Activiti Engine in the JVM with an in-memory database (H2)
- Running the Activiti Engine in the JVM with a standalone database (H2)
- Running the Activiti Engine on an application server (Apache Tomcat) with a
standalone database (H2)

## part2
### Activiti Engine API

- **RuntimeService**: The runtime service provides an interface to start and query process instances. In addition, process variables can be retrieved and set, and processes can be signaled to leave a wait state.
- **TaskService**: Exposes operations to manage human (standalone) Tasks, such as claiming, completing and assigning tasks.
- **RepositoryService**: The repository service provides functionality to deploy, query, delete, and retrieve process definitions. 
- **IdentityService**: Used for managing Users, Groups and the relations between them
- **ManagementService**: The management service can be used to query the Activiti tables and execute jobs.
- **HistoryService**: To retrieve information about completed process instances.
- **FormService**: To work with the user task forms generated by the Activiti form engine, the form service provides several methods.

#### RuntimeService

The primary usage of the RuntimeService is to start new process instances based on a
specific process definition.

#### TaskService

- add task
- The user or group assigned as a candidate
- Only one user can be assigned through task
- Claim and complete a task

**@Deployment**
With the @Deployment, the book order process definition is deployed to the Activiti engine.

**@Rule**
public ActivitiRule activitiRule = new ActivitiRule("activiti.cfg-mem.xml");

If no "activiti.cfg-mem.xml", then use the default "activiti.cfg.xml"

#### RepositoryService

It can also be used to query the Activiti engine for deployment artifacts and
process definitions. In this section(4.2.3), you’ll also use the delete functionality, which the
RepositoryService interface provides.

The RepositoryService interface provides two types of delete methods:
- The deleteDeployment method with a deployment identifier and a **false** input
parameter, which only deletes the deployment and not the corresponding process
instance data. When there are still running process instances, you’ll get an
exception when running this method.
- The deleteDeployment method with a deployment identifier and a **true** input
parameter, which deletes all information regarding the process definition, running
instances, and history. If you want all process data, including running process
instances, to be deleted, you should use a Boolean value of true for the
second input parameter.
